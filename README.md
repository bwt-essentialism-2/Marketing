**Proposal**

---

- **What problem does your app solve?**
    - Regain control of our own choices about where to spend our time and energies.
    - Helps identify what values are important to someone
    - Narrows your focus to what is important, de-clutters your mind.
- **Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?**
    - Our application tackles this challenge by introducing our users to a simple yet impactful interface that allows for one to find the things that matter most and also understand why. Branching from this we have incorporated some functionality that allows users to add some projects that align with their selected interests.
- **What is the mission statement?**
    - Start spending your time smarter for the things that matter most.
    - Focus, at your fingertips.
    - To aid in a more productive lifestyle
    - To help people rediscover what’s most important

# **Features**

---

- **What features are required for your minimum viable product?**
1. An on-boarding process for a new user

(List: Athletic ability • Art and literature • Creativity, discovering, or inventing things to make a difference in the world • Independence • Kindness and generosity • Living in the moment • Membership in a social group (such as your community, racial group, or school club) • Music • My community • My moral principles • Nature and the environment • Relationships with friends and family • Sense of humor • Success in my career • Other: _________________).
3. Create a page that then shows the list of values the person chose. Prompt the user to now choose the top 3 that are the MOST important to them. Then give students the prompt: In a few sentences, describe why the selected values are important to you. Focus on your thoughts/feelings, and don’t worry about spelling, grammar, or how well-written it is.
4. Prompt to list all your current projects and things you’re involved in
5. Page to Compare your values to your current projects.
6. Ability to easily edit / delete all data.

- **What feedback have you gotten from potential users?**
    - 
- **Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How? ----> Yes, they told me so.**
- 

**Research**

---

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.

# **Prototype Key Feature(s)**

---

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
